This map was created for the Students and Staff of Dublin Institute of Technology 
to aid travel goals of the organization by promoting public transport, walking and 
cycling to work and college. This map is delivered to every incoming student to help 
them orientate themselves to DIT's diverse number of locations. Many students will not
 have lived in Dublin before, so this allows them to get their bearings in the city.
