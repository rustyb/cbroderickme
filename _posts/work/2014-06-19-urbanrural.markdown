UrbanRural was a web app I developed for the #AppsforFingal, Fingal Open Data competition.
It was shortlisted for inclusion on the competition website. The premise for this app was to
allow people to discover the unique pieces of built heritage within Fingal they may not
have been aware even existed. This app used data from the Fingal Open Data Store on protected structures.
