Our friends and colleagues of the [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=9/-29.4982/28.3090) community and the physical planners of Lesotho, have been busy mapping Lesotho on **OSM**. 

The planners in Lesotho have identified a need for them to be able to identify areas where building is proceeding.

The main reason for this is so the planners can prioritize the preparation of layout plans for areas where building is occurring.

To do this we can mark buildings on OSM with the tag
	
	building=construction
	

Below you can find a map showing the current hotspots of under construction buildings in Lesotho. By zooming all the way in you will be able to see the individual buildings.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
